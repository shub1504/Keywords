 it is an integrated circuit that's custom designed for a particular task or application. 

# 11.OSI MODEL(7 LAYERS)->
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and design network communication systems. It has following layers:-
**1. Physical Layer (Layer 1)**
     *Function: Deals with the physical connection between devices. It involves the transmission and reception of raw binary data (0s and 1s) over a physical medium, such as cables or wireless signals.
     *Examples: Ethernet cables, fiber optics, radio waves, network interface cards (NICs).

**2. Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**
     *Function: Provides node-to-node data transfer and handles error detection and correction from the Physical layer. It ensures that data packets are delivered to the correct device on a local network.
     *Examples: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, MAC (Media Access Control) addresses, switches.

**3.Network Layer (Layer 3)**
     *Function: Manages data routing, forwarding, and addressing. It determines the best path for data to travel from the source to the destination across multiple networks.
     *Examples: IP (Internet Protocol), routers, IP addresses.

**4.Transport Layer (Layer 4)**
     *Function: Ensures end-to-end communication and data integrity between devices. It manages data flow control, error correction, and retransmission.
     *Examples: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

**5.Session Layer (Layer 5)**
     *Function: Manages sessions or connections between applications. It establishes, maintains, and terminates communication sessions.
     *Examples: Session establishment protocols, APIs for session management.

**6.Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**
     *Function: Translates data between the application layer and the network. It is responsible for data translation, encryption, and compression.
     *Examples: Data encryption (e.g., SSL/TLS), data translation formats (e.g., JPEG, GIF).

**7.Application Layer (Layer 7)**
     *Function: Provides network services directly to end-user applications. It facilitates user interface and application-level data exchanges.
     *Examples: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), email clients, web browsers.

# 12.Hardware->
Computer hardware refers to the physical components that make up a computer system. These components work together to perform various functions, enabling the computer to process, store, and output data. It includes CPU,RAM,STORAGE DEVICES etc.

# 13.Server->
A server is a specialized computer or device that provides services, data, or resources to other computers over a network. The primary function of a server is to manage, store, send, and process data, allowing multiple users or devices to access it simultaneously. Servers are a key part of network architecture, playing a vital role in everything from websites to cloud computing.
  **Types of Servers**
  * File Server
  * Web Server
  * Database Server
  * Mail Server
  * Application Server
  * Proxy Server
  * DNS Server
  * Game Server

# 14.Storage->
Storage in the context of computing refers to the components and systems that allow data to be saved, retrieved, and managed over time. Unlike memory (RAM), which is temporary and volatile, storage is where data is kept permanently or semi-permanently, even when a computer is turned off. Storage can exist in different forms, each designed to handle various types of data, capacity requirements, and access speeds. 

**Types of Storage**
* Primary Storage: includes RAM
* Secondary Storage:includes HDD's,SSD's
* Tertiary Storage:includes tape drives

# 15.Bare Metal
Bare metal refers to a physical computer or server that is not running any virtualization or hypervisor layer, meaning it operates directly on the underlying hardware without any abstraction. Bare metal servers are designed for maximum performance and control, as all the server's hardware resources (CPU, memory, storage) are dedicated entirely to the operating system and applications running on it.

# 16.Virtual Machine
A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer that runs an operating system and applications just like a physical machine. Virtual machines are created and managed using a hypervisor, which allows multiple VMs to run on a single physical server, sharing the underlying hardware resources (CPU, memory, storage, etc.).

# 17.Frontend Development
Frontend development is the process of building the part of a website or web application that users interact with directly. It focuses on the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) by creating visually appealing, functional, and responsive designs that work seamlessly across different devices and browsers. The key goal of frontend development is to ensure that everything users see and engage with is easy to use, efficient, and visually aligned with the overall design goals of the website or application.

# 18.Backend Development
Backend development refers to the server-side part of web development, which focuses on the logic, database interactions, server configuration, and application architecture that power the frontend of a website or application. While the frontend is responsible for what users see and interact with, the backend is what happens behind the scenes, ensuring that the application functions smoothly by processing user requests, retrieving data, and delivering the correct responses.

# 19.Fullstack Development 
Full-stack development refers to the practice of developing both the frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side) portions of a web application or software. A full-stack developer is someone who is proficient in working with both frontend and backend technologies, meaning they can handle all aspects of building a complete web application, from the user interface to the underlying server logic and database management.Full-stack development encompasses the entire process of building a web application, from the user interface to the backend logic and database management. 


**TECHNOLOGIES USED IN FRONTEND & BACKEND DEVELOPMENT**

* HTML
* JavaScript
* CSS
* Responsive Design
* Frontend frameworks and libraries

2.BACKEND DEVELOPEMNT
