# Keywords

1.**COMPUTING**
* CPU(CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT)->The CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is often referred to as the "brain" of a computer. used for interpretation, processes and executions.

* GPU(GRAPHIC PROCESSING UNIT)->The GPU, or Graphics Processing Unit, is a specialized processor designed to accelerate the rendering of images and video  performs mathematical calculations at high speed.
  
* DPU(DATA PROCESSING UNIT)->A DPU, or Data Processing Unit, is a specialized processor designed to handle data-centric tasks efficiently.  perform as a helper for CPU by taking over it's networking and communication workloads.

* TPU(TENSOR PROCESSING UNIT)->A TPU, or Tensor Processing Unit, is a type of specialized hardware designed by Google specifically for accelerating machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) workloads.  it is a Google's custom-developed application-specific integrated circuits(ASICs) used to accelerate machine learning workloads.

2.**operating system**

An operating system (OS) is the software that manages a computer's hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs.
It's essentially the backbone of a computer system, enabling users to interact with the hardware and run applications.

* **CISC**->CISC, or Complex Instruction Set Computer, is a computer architecture in which single instructions can execute several low level operations or are capable of multi step operations or addressing modes within single instructions. 

* **RISC**->RISC, or Reduced Instruction Set Computer, is a type of microprocessor architecture that utilizes a small,highly optimised set of instructions rather than highly-specialized set of instructions typically found in architecture.

* **RISC-V**->  it is a open source instruction set architecture used to develop custom processors for a variety of applications 

* **KERNAL**->it is a computer program at the core of a computer's operation system and generally has complete control over everything in the system.
It is also responsible for preventing and mitigating conflicts between different processes. 
Example : Linux 

* **LINUX**-> It is a open source operating system made by Linus torvalds came under UNIX(uniplexed information computer system) 
It has two types of families:-
• Debian - it contains operating system like UBUNTU
• RHEL - It contain operating system like centOS,oracle,fedora,red hat 

3.**NETWORK**
A network is a system that connects multiple devices, allowing them to communicate with each other and share resources.

**TYPES OF NETWORK**
* **LOCAL AREA NETWORK(LAN)**-> A network that connects devices within a limited area, such as a home, office, or campus. LANs are typically used to share resources like printers and files and to facilitate communication between devices.

*  **PERSONAL AREA NETWORK(PAN)**->A small-scale network, often used for connecting devices within a personal workspace or home. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi networks are examples of PANs.

*   **METROPOLITIAN AREA NETWORK(MAN)**->A network that covers a city or a large campus. MANs are often used by municipalities or large organizations to connect multiple buildings or sites within a city.

*   **WIDE AREA NETWORK(WAN)**->A network that covers a city or a large campus. MANs are often used by municipalities or large organizations to connect multiple buildings or sites within a city.

*   **VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK(VPN)**->A network that uses encryption and other techniques to provide secure access to a private network over a public network, like the Internet. VPNs are used to protect sensitive data and allow remote users to access resources securely.

# 4.Cloud Computing->
it is the delivery of computing services- including servers,storage,databases,network,software etc. For eg : Zoom,Google Docs

# 5.IP Address->
Its an address to identify a device on internet or on local internet.
Types of IP address :- 
1. Private 
2. Public 
3. Local

# 6.DOMAIN NAME SERVER(DNS)->
 it is a server responsible for keeping the file that contains information about the domain name and corresponding IP addresses as well as to provide information about the domain name and IP address during the DNS query.

# 7.HYPERVISOR->
 A program used to run and manage two or more virtual machine on a single physical machine. 
There are two types of HYPERVISOR:- 
1. Type-1:- no need of OS 
2. Type-2:- need of OS 

# 8.GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION(GDPR)->
