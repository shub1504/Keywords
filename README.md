# Keywords

1.**COMPUTING**
* CPU(CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT)->The CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is often referred to as the "brain" of a computer. It's the primary component responsible for executing instructions from programs and managing the operations of the computer.
  
* GPU(GRAPHIC PROCESSING UNIT)->The GPU, or Graphics Processing Unit, is a specialized processor designed to accelerate the rendering of images and video. It’s optimized for handling the complex calculations required for graphics rendering, making it crucial for visual output in computers, gaming consoles, and mobile devices.
  
* DPU(DATA PROCESSING UNIT)->A DPU, or Data Processing Unit, is a specialized processor designed to handle data-centric tasks efficiently. It focuses on managing and processing large volumes of data, often in the context of network, storage, and data center operations. Here’s a closer look at its key functions and features.
  
* TPU(TENSOR PROCESSING UNIT)->A TPU, or Tensor Processing Unit, is a type of specialized hardware designed by Google specifically for accelerating machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. TPUs are optimized for processing tensors, which are multidimensional arrays used extensively in machine learning models.

2.**operating system**

An operating system (OS) is the software that manages a computer's hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs.
It's essentially the backbone of a computer system, enabling users to interact with the hardware and run applications.
