# Keywords

1.**COMPUTING**
* CPU(CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT)->The CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is often referred to as the "brain" of a computer. It's the primary component responsible for executing instructions from programs and managing the operations of the computer.
  
* GPU(GRAPHIC PROCESSING UNIT)->The GPU, or Graphics Processing Unit, is a specialized processor designed to accelerate the rendering of images and video. Itâ€™s optimized for handling the complex calculations required for graphics rendering, making it crucial for visual output in computers, gaming consoles, and mobile devices.
  
* DPU(DATA PROCESSING UNIT)->A DPU, or Data Processing Unit, is a specialized processor designed to handle data-centric tasks efficiently. It focuses on managing and processing large volumes of data, often in the context of network, storage, and data center operations. 
  
* TPU(TENSOR PROCESSING UNIT)->A TPU, or Tensor Processing Unit, is a type of specialized hardware designed by Google specifically for accelerating machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. TPUs are optimized for processing tensors, which are multidimensional arrays used extensively in machine learning models.

2.**operating system**

An operating system (OS) is the software that manages a computer's hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs.
It's essentially the backbone of a computer system, enabling users to interact with the hardware and run applications.

* **CISC**->CISC, or Complex Instruction Set Computer, is a type of computer architecture that aims to provide a rich set of instructions for executing a wide variety of tasks directly in hardware.

* **RISC**->RISC, or Reduced Instruction Set Computer, is a type of computer architecture that focuses on a simplified set of instructions compared to CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) architectures. The RISC approach emphasizes efficiency and speed by using a smaller, more streamlined set of instructions.

* **RISC-V**-> is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on the principles of Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) design.

* **KERNAL**->The term "kernel" refers to the core component of an operating system (OS) that manages system resources and enables communication between hardware and software.

* **LINUX**->Linux is a widely-used open-source operating system kernel that serves as the foundation for many operating systems, commonly referred to as Linux distributions or distros.

3.**NETWORK**
A network is a system that connects multiple devices, allowing them to communicate with each other and share resources.

**TYPES OF NETWORK**
* **LOCAL AREA NETWORK(LAN)**-> A network that connects devices within a limited area, such as a home, office, or campus. LANs are typically used to share resources like printers and files and to facilitate communication between devices.

*  **PERSONAL AREA NETWORK(PAN)**->A small-scale network, often used for connecting devices within a personal workspace or home. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi networks are examples of PANs.

*   **METROPOLITIAN AREA NETWORK(MAN)**->A network that covers a city or a large campus. MANs are often used by municipalities or large organizations to connect multiple buildings or sites within a city.

*   **WIDE AREA NETWORK(WAN)**->A network that covers a city or a large campus. MANs are often used by municipalities or large organizations to connect multiple buildings or sites within a city.

*   **VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK(VPN)**->A network that uses encryption and other techniques to provide secure access to a private network over a public network, like the Internet. VPNs are used to protect sensitive data and allow remote users to access resources securely.
